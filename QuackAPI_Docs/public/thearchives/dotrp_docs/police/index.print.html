<h1 id="the-meaning-of-your-oath">THE MEANING OF YOUR OATH</h1>
<p>Upon being sworn in as an officer of the Los Santos Police Department, an officer incurs a lasting obligation to cherish and protect their state and to develop within themselves that capacity and reserve strength which will enable them to serve its arms and welfare of their peers with increasing wisdom, diligence, and patriotic conviction.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of their oath. It is not modified by any reason of assignment while in the service, nor is the obligation lessened on the day oan officer puts the uniform aside and returns to civil life. Having been specially chosen by Los Santos to sustain the dignity and integrity of its sovereign power, an officer is expected to so maintain themselves, and so to exert their influence for so long as he may live, that they will be recognized as a worthy symbol of all that is best in character.</p>
<p>In this sense the trust imposed in the highest commander in the department is not more than what is encharged to the newest cadet or lieutenant. Nor is it less. It is the fact of commission which gives special distinction to the officer and in turn requires that the measure of their devotion to the service of their country be distinctive, as compared with the charge laid upon the average citizen.</p>
<h1 id="code-of-ethics">CODE OF ETHICS</h1>
<p>As a law enforcement officer, my fundamental duty is to serve the community; to safeguard lives and property; to protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression or intimidation and the peaceful against violence or disorder; and to respect the constitutional rights of all to liberty, equality, and justice.</p>
<p>I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all and will behave in a manner that does not bring discredit to me or to my agency. I will maintain courageous calm in the face of danger, scorn or ridicule; develop self-restraint; and be constantly mindful of the welfare of others. Honest in thought and deed both in my personal and official life, I will be exemplary in obeying the law and the regulations of my department. Whatever I see or hear of a confidential nature or that is confided to me in my official capacity will be kept ever secret unless revelation is necessary in the performance of my duty.</p>
<p>I will never act officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices, political beliefs, aspirations, animosities or friendships to influence my decisions. With no compromise for crime and with relentless prosecution of criminals, I will enforce the law courteously and appropriately without fear or favor, malice or ill will, never employing unnecessary force or violence and never accepting gratuities.</p>
<p>I recognize the badge of my office as a symbol of public faith, and I accept it as a public trust to be held so long as I am true to the ethics of police service. I will never engage in acts of corruption or bribery, nor will I condone such acts by other police officers. I will cooperate with all legally authorized agencies and their representatives in the pursuit of justice.</p>
<p>I know that I alone am responsible for my own standard of professional performance and will take every reasonable opportunity to enhance and improve my level of knowledge and competence.</p>
<p>I will constantly strive to achieve these objectives and ideals, dedicating myself before God to my chosen profession… law enforcement</p>
<h1 id="code-of-conduct">CODE OF CONDUCT</h1>
<h2 id="article-1">Article 1</h2>
<p>Law enforcement officials shall at all times fulfill the duty imposed upon them by law, by serving the community and by protecting all persons against illegal acts, consistent with the high degree of responsibility required by their profession.</p>
<p>Commentary :</p>
<p>(a) The term &ldquo;law enforcement officials&rdquo;, includes all officers of the law, whether appointed or elected, who exercise police powers, especially the powers of arrest or detention.</p>
<p>(b) Service to the community is intended to include particularly the rendition of services of assistance to those members of the community who by reason of personal, economic, social or other emergencies are in need of immediate aid.</p>
<p>(c) This provision is intended to cover not only all violent, predatory and harmful acts, but extends to the full range of prohibitions under penal statutes. It extends to conduct by persons not capable of incurring criminal liability.</p>
<h2 id="article-2">Article 2</h2>
<p>In the performance of their duty, law enforcement officials shall respect and protect human dignity and maintain and uphold the human rights of all persons.</p>
<p>Commentary :</p>
<p>(a) The human rights in question are identified and protected by national and international law. Among the relevant international instruments are the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid , the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.</p>
<p>(b) National commentaries to this provision should indicate regional or national provisions identifying and protecting these rights</p>
<p>Article 3</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty.</p>
<p>Commentary :</p>
<p>(a) This provision emphasizes that the use of force by law enforcement officials should be exceptional; while it implies that law enforcement officials may be authorized to use force as is reasonably necessary under the circumstances for the prevention of crime or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders, no force going beyond that may be used.</p>
<p>(b) National law ordinarily restricts the use of force by law enforcement officials in accordance with a principle of proportionality. It is to be understood that such national principles of proportionality are to be respected in the interpretation of this provision. In no case should this provision be interpreted to authorize the use of force which is disproportionate to the legitimate objective to be achieved.</p>
<p>(c) The use of firearms is considered an extreme measure. Every effort should be made to exclude the use of firearms, especially against children. In general, firearms should not be used except when a suspected offender offers armed resistance or otherwise jeopardizes the lives of others and less extreme measures are not sufficient to restrain or apprehend the suspected offender. In every instance in which a firearm is discharged, a report should be made promptly to the competent authorities</p>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<h2 id="article-4">Article 4</h2>
<p>Matters of a confidential nature in the possession of law enforcement officials shall be kept confidential, unless the performance of duty or the needs of justice strictly require otherwise.</p>
<p>Commentary :</p>
<p>By the nature of their duties, law enforcement officials obtain information which may relate to private lives or be potentially harmful to the interests, and especially the reputation, of others. Great care should be exercised in safeguarding and using such information, which should be disclosed only in the performance of duty or to serve the needs of justice. Any disclosure of such information for other purposes is wholly improper.</p>
<h2 id="article-5">Article 5</h2>
<p>No law enforcement official may inflict, instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, nor may any law enforcement official invoke superior orders or exceptional circumstances such as a state of war or a threat of war, a threat to national security, internal political instability or any other public emergency as a justification of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p>
<p>Commentary :</p>
<p>(a) This prohibition derives from the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted by the General Assembly, according to which:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Such an act is] an offence to human dignity and shall be condemned as a denial of the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and as a violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [and other international human rights instruments].&rdquo;</p>
<p>(b) The Declaration defines torture as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession, punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating him or other persons. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions to the extent consistent with the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(c) The term &ldquo;cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&rdquo; has not been defined by the General Assembly but should be interpreted so as to extend the widest possible protection against abuses, whether physical or mental.</p>
<h2 id="article-5-1">Article 5</h2>
<p>No law enforcement official may inflict, instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, nor may any law enforcement official invoke superior orders or exceptional circumstances such as a state of war or a threat of war, a threat to national security, internal political instability or any other public emergency as a justification of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p>
<p>Commentary :</p>
<p>(a) This prohibition derives from the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted by the General Assembly, according to which:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Such an act is] an offence to human dignity and shall be condemned as a denial of the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and as a violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [and other international human rights instruments].&rdquo;</p>
<p>(b) The Declaration defines torture as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . . torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession, punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating him or other persons. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions to the extent consistent with the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(c) The term &ldquo;cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&rdquo; has not been defined by the General Assembly but should be interpreted so as to extend the widest possible protection against abuses, whether physical or mental.</p>
<h2 id="article-7">Article 7</h2>
<p>Law enforcement officials shall not commit any act of corruption. They shall also rigorously oppose and combat all such acts.</p>
<p>Commentary :</p>
<p>(a) Any act of corruption, in the same way as any other abuse of authority, is incompatible with the profession of law enforcement officials. The law must be enforced fully with respect to any law enforcement official who commits an act of corruption, as Governments cannot expect to enforce the law among their citizens if they cannot, or will not, enforce the law against their own agents and within their agencies.</p>
<p>(b) While the definition of corruption must be subject to national law, it should be understood to encompass the commission or omission of an act in the performance of or in connection with one&rsquo;s duties, in response to gifts, promises or incentives demanded or accepted, or the wrongful receipt of these once the act has been committed or omitted.</p>
<p>(c) The expression &ldquo;act of corruption&rdquo; referred to above should be understood to encompass attempted corruption.</p>
<h2 id="article-8">Article 8</h2>
<p>Law enforcement officials shall respect the law and the present Code. They shall also, to the best of their capability, prevent and rigorously oppose any violations of them.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials who have reason to believe that a violation of the present Code has occurred or is about to occur shall report the matter to their superior authorities and, where necessary, to other appropriate authorities or organs vested with reviewing or remedial power.</p>
<p>Commentary :</p>
<p>(a) This Code shall be observed whenever it has been incorporated into national legislation or practice. If legislation or practice contains stricter provisions than those of the present Code, those stricter provisions shall be observed.</p>
<p>(b) The article seeks to preserve the balance between the need for internal discipline of the agency on which public safety is largely dependent, on the one hand, and the need for dealing with violations of basic human rights, on the other. Law enforcement officials shall report violations within the chain of command and take other lawful action outside the chain of command only when no other remedies are available or effective. It is understood that law enforcement officials shall not suffer administrative or other penalties because they have reported that a violation of this Code has occurred or is about to occur.</p>
<p>(c) The term &ldquo;appropriate authorities or organs vested with reviewing or remedial power&rdquo; refers to any authority or organ existing under national law, whether internal to the law enforcement agency or independent thereof, with statutory, customary or other power to review grievances and complaints arising out of violations within the purview of this Code.</p>
<p>(d) In some countries, the mass media may be regarded as performing complaint review functions similar to those described in subparagraph (c) above. Law enforcement officials may, therefore, be justified if, as a last resort and in accordance with the laws and customs of their own countries and with the provisions of article 4 of the present Code, they bring violations to the attention of public opinion through the mass media.</p>
<p>(e) Law enforcement officials who comply with the provisions of this Code deserve the respect, the full support and the co-operation of the community and of the law enforcement agency in which they serve, as well as the law enforcement profession.</p>
<p>ARREST &amp; DETAINMENT POLICIES</p>
<h2 id="article-1-1">Article 1</h2>
<p>In common law, investigative detention refers purely to a method of holding someone while a suspicious situation is being checked out. Detainment needs only reasonable suspicion to be carried out. At this point the detainee must identify.</p>
<h2 id="article-2-1">Article 2</h2>
<p>When an officer stops someone to search the person, courts require that the officer has either a search warrant, probable cause to search, or a reasonable suspicion to search. In descending order of what gives an officer the broadest authority to perform a search.</p>
<p>If an officer has reasonable suspicion in a situation, he may frisk or detain the suspect briefly. Reasonable suspicion does not allow for the searching of a person or a vehicle unless the person happens to be on school property. Reasonable suspicion is not enough for an arrest or a search warrant.</p>
<p>In any situation where handcuffs, improvised or otherwise, are in use, the detaining officer should do his due diligence every 5-7 minutes to maintain that the cuffs are functioning properly.</p>
<h2 id="article-3">Article 3</h2>
<p>In the event that an arrest is made under probable cause the suspect should be detained, read their Miranda rights, and escorted back to base to be charged and await their hearing.</p>
<p>Probable cause means that a reasonable person would believe that a crime was in the process of being committed, had been committed, or was going to be committed.</p>
<p>Probable cause is enough for a search or arrest warrant. It is also enough for a police officer to make an arrest if he sees a crime being committed.</p>
<h2 id="article-4-1">Article 4</h2>
<p>It is not the duty of LSPD peace officers to negotiate with or plead down charges. That is the sole duty of the District Attorney, prosecutors and the Judge.</p>
<h1 id="miranda-rights">MIRANDA RIGHTS</h1>
<ol>
<li>You have the right to remain silent.</li>

<p>ESCALATION OF FORCE POLICIES</p>
<h2 id="i-preamble-to-use-of-force">I. PREAMBLE TO USE OF FORCE.</h2>
<p>The use of force by members of law enforcement is a matter of critical concern both to the public and the law enforcement community. It is recognized that some individuals will not comply with the law or submit to control unless compelled to do so by the use of force; therefore, law enforcement officers are sometimes called upon to use force in the performance of their duties. The Los Angeles Police Department also recognizes that members of law enforcement derive their authority from the public and therefore must be ever mindful that they are not only the guardians but also the servants of the public.</p>
<p>The Department&rsquo;s guiding principle when using force shall be reverence for human life. Officers shall attempt to control an incident by using time, distance, communication, and available resources in an effort to de-escalate the situation, whenever it is safe, feasible and reasonable to do so. As stated below, when warranted, Department personnel may use objectively reasonable force to carry out their duties. Officers may use deadly force only when they reasonably believe, based on the totality of circumstances, that such force is necessary in defense of human life. Officers who use unreasonable force degrade the confidence of the community we serve, expose fellow officers to physical hazards, violate the law and rights of individuals upon whom unreasonable force or unnecessary deadly force is used, and subject the Department and themselves to potential civil and criminal liability. Conversely, officers who fail to use force when warranted may endanger themselves, the community and fellow officers.</p>

It is the policy of this Department that, whenever feasible, officers shall use techniques and tools consistent with Department de-escalation training to reduce the intensity of any encounter with a suspect and enable an officer to have additional options to mitigate the need to use a higher level of force while maintaining control of the situation.</p>
<h2 id="special-order-no-1">SPECIAL ORDER NO. 1</h2>
<p>Verbal Warnings. Where feasible, a peace officer shall, prior to the use of any force, make reasonable efforts to identify themselves as a peace officer and to warn that force may be used, unless the officer has objectively reasonable grounds to believe that the person is aware of those facts.</p>
<p>Proportionality. Officers may only use a level of force that they reasonably believe is proportional to the seriousness of the suspected offense or the reasonably perceived level of actual or threatened resistance.</p>
<p>Fair and Unbiased Policing. Officers shall carry out their duties, including use of force, in a manner that is fair and unbiased. Discriminatory conduct on the basis of race, religion, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, housing status, or disability while preforming any law enforcement activity is prohibited.</p>
<p>Use of Force − Non-Deadly. It is the policy of this Department that personnel may use only that force which is &ldquo;objectively reasonable&rdquo; to:</p>
<p>• Defend themselves;</p>
<p>• Defend others;</p>
<p>• Effect an arrest or detention;</p>
<p>• Prevent escape; or,</p>
<p>• Overcome resistance.</p>
<p>Factors Used to Determine Objective Reasonableness. Pursuant to the opinion issued by the United States Supreme Court in Graham v. Connor, the Department examines the reasonableness of any particular force used: a) from the perspective of a reasonable Los Angeles Police Officer with similar training and experience, in the same situation; and b) based on the facts and circumstances of each particular case. Those factors may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>• The feasibility of using de-escalation tactics, crisis intervention or other alternatives to force;</p>
<p>• The seriousness of the crime or suspected offense;</p>
<p>• The level of threat or resistance presented by the subject;</p>
<p>• Whether the subject was posing an immediate threat to officers or a danger</p>
<p>to the community;</p>
<p>• The potential for injury to citizens, officers or subjects;</p>
<p>• The risk or apparent attempt by the subject to escape;</p>
<p>• The conduct of the subject being confronted (as reasonably perceived by</p>
<p>the officer at the time);</p>
<p>• The amount of time and any changing circumstances during which the</p>
<p>officer had to determine the type and amount of force that appeared to be reasonable;</p>
<p>• The availability of other resources;</p>
<p>• The training and experience of the officer;</p>
<p>• The proximity or access of weapons to the subject;</p>
<h2 id="special-order-no-2">SPECIAL ORDER NO. 2</h2>
<p>• Officer versus subject factors such as age, size, relative strength, skill</p>
<p>level, injury/exhaustion and number of officers versus subjects; and,</p>
<p>• The environmental factors and/or other exigent circumstances.</p>
<p>Drawing or Exhibiting Firearms. Unnecessarily or prematurely drawing or exhibiting a firearm limits an officer&rsquo;s alternatives in controlling a situation, creates unnecessary anxiety on the part of citizens, and may result in an unwarranted or accidental discharge of the firearm. Officers shall not draw or exhibit a firearm unless the circumstances surrounding the incident create a reasonable belief that it may be necessary to use the firearm. When an officer has determined that the use of deadly force is not necessary, the officer shall, as soon as practicable, secure or holster the firearm. Any drawing and exhibiting of a firearm shall conform with this policy on the use of firearms. Moreover, any intentional pointing of a firearm at a person by an officer shall be reported. Such reporting will be published in the Department&rsquo;s year-end use of force report.</p>
<p>Use of Force − Deadly. It is the policy of this Department that officers shall use deadly force upon another person only when the officer reasonably believes, based on the totality of circumstances, that such force is necessary for either of the following reasons:</p>
<p>• To defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to</p>
<p>the officer or to another person; or</p>
<p>• To apprehend a fleeing person for any felony that threatened or resulted in</p>
<p>death or serious bodily injury, if the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause death or serious bodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended.</p>
<p>In determining whether deadly force is necessary, officers shall evaluate each situation in light of the particular circumstances of each case and shall use other available resources and techniques if reasonably safe and feasible. Before discharging a firearm, officers shall consider their surroundings and potential risks to bystanders to the extent reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Note: Because the application of deadly force is limited to the above scenarios, an officer shall not use deadly force against a person based on the danger that person poses to themselves, if an objectively reasonable officer would believe the person does not pose an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or another person.</p>
<p>Department&rsquo;s Evaluation of Deadly Force. The Department will analyze an officer&rsquo;s use of deadly force by evaluating the totality of the circumstances of each case consistent with California Penal Code Section 835(a) as well as the factors articulated in Graham v. Connor.</p>
<h2 id="special-order-no-3">SPECIAL ORDER NO. 3</h2>
<p>Rendering Aid. After any use of force, officers shall promptly provide basic and emergency medical assistance to all members of the community, including victims, witnesses, subjects, suspects, persons in custody, subjects of a use of force and fellow officers:</p>
<p>• To the extent of the officer&rsquo;s training and experience in first aid/CPR/AED; and</p>
<p>• To the level of equipment available to an officer at the time assistance is</p>
<p>needed.</p>
<p>Warning Shots. It is the policy of this Department that warning shots shall only be used in exceptional circumstances where it might reasonably be expected to avoid the need to use deadly force. Generally, warning shots shall be directed in a manner that minimizes the risk of injury to innocent persons, ricochet dangers and property damage.</p>
<p>Shooting at or From Moving Vehicles. It is the policy of this Department that firearms shall not be discharged at a moving vehicle unless a person in the vehicle is immediately threatening the officer or another person with deadly force by means other than the vehicle. The moving vehicle itself shall not presumptively constitute a threat that justifies an officer&rsquo;s use of deadly force. An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall move out of its path instead of discharging a firearm at it or any of its occupants. Firearms shall not be discharged from a moving vehicle, except in exigent circumstances and consistent with this policy regarding the use of Deadly Force.</p>
<p>Note: It is understood that the policy regarding discharging a firearm at or from a moving vehicle may not cover every situation that may arise. In all situations, officers are expected to act with intelligence and exercise sound judgment, attending to the spirit of this policy. Any deviations from the provisions of this policy shall be examined rigorously on a case by case basis. The involved officer must be able to clearly articulate the reasons for the use of deadly force. Factors that may be considered include whether the officer&rsquo;s life or the lives of others were in immediate peril and there was no reasonable or apparent means of escape.</p>
<p>Requirement to Report Potential Excessive Force. An officer who is present and observes another officer using force that the present and observing officer believes to be beyond that which is necessary, as determined by an objectively reasonable officer under the circumstances based upon the totality of information actually known to the officer, shall report such force to a superior officer.</p>
<h2 id="special-order-no-4">SPECIAL ORDER NO. 4</h2>
<p>Requirement to Intercede When Excessive Force is Observed. An officer shall intercede when present and observing another officer using force that is clearly beyond that which is necessary, as determined by an objectively reasonable officer under the circumstances, taking into account the possibility that other officers may have additional information regarding the threat posed by a subject.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">DEFINITIONS.</h3>
<p><strong>Deadly Force.</strong> Deadly force is defined as any use of force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily injury, including but not limited to, the discharge of a firearm.</p>
<p><strong>Feasible.</strong> Feasible means reasonably capable of being done or carried out under the circumstances to successfully achieve the arrest or lawful objective without increasing risk to the officer or another person.</p>
<p><strong>Imminent.</strong> Pursuant to California Penal Code Section 835a(e)(2), &ldquo;[A] threat of death or serious bodily injury is &ldquo;imminent&rdquo; when, based on the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily injury to the peace officer or another person. An imminent harm is not merely a fear of future harm, no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm, but is one that, from appearances, must be instantly confronted and addressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Necessary.</strong> In addition to California Penal Code 835(a), the Department shall evaluate whether deadly force was necessary by looking at: a) the totality of the circumstances from the perspective of a reasonable Los Angeles Police Officer with similar training and experience; b) the factors used to evaluate whether force is objectively reasonable; c) an evaluation of whether the officer exhausted the available and feasible alternatives to deadly force; and d) whether a warning was feasible and/or given.</p>
<p><strong>Objectively Reasonable.</strong> The legal standard used to determine the lawfulness of a use of force is based on the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989). Graham states, in part, &ldquo;The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight. The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments − in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving − about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation. The test of reasonableness is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The force must be reasonable under the circumstances known to or reasonably believed by the officer at the time the force was used. Therefore, the Department examines all uses of force from an objective standard rather than a subjective standard.</p>
<h2 id="special-order-no-5">SPECIAL ORDER NO. 5</h2>
<p>Serious Bodily Injury. Pursuant to California Penal Code Section 243(f)(4) Serious Bodily Injury includes but is not limited to:</p>
<p>• Loss of consciousness;</p>
<p>• Concussion;</p>
<p>• Bone Fracture;</p>
<p>• Protracted loss or impairment of function of any bodily member or organ;</p>
<p>• A wound requiring extensive suturing; and,</p>
<p>• Serious disfigurement.</p>
<p><strong>Totality of the Circumstances.</strong> All facts known to or reasonably perceived by the officer at the time, including the conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of force.</p>
<p><strong>Warning Shots.</strong> The intentional discharge of a firearm off target not intended to hit a person, to warn others that deadly force is imminent.</p>

<h1 id="broadcast-rules-and-procedures">BROADCAST RULES AND PROCEDURES</h1>
<p>Precision, accuracy, and professionalism are key points in the field of telecommunications operations. Increased radio traffic has created the need to deliver clear, concise, exact information to officers in the field in a minimal amount of air time. Although each telecommunicator has highly individualized ideas of how dispatching/operating should be performed, this disparity has created certain problems, technical and operational, which are easily recognized by the experienced operator. Following a list of procedures for operating; many of which serve to exemplify problems inherent to telecommunications:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Verify the transmitter is working before starting to speak. Make certain that the transmitter remains on during the entire transmission and that it is turned off when the transmission ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When another operator or station is using a frequency, do not attempt to &ldquo;talk over&rdquo; their communication on that same frequency. Never break into another station&rsquo;s transmission unless an emergency exists and it and it has been determined after monitoring that the traffic in progress is not of an emergency nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to use the ten-signals and phonetic alphabet correctly. Ten-signals are complete in themselves, and if not used properly may cause confusion. Avoid using more than two ten-signals in any given phrase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transmit all information as briefly and accurately as possible, carefully editing messages without changing the meaning of the contents. Make certain the information is clear and concise before beginning the transmission, so that further explanation is unnecessary. <strong>DO NOT</strong> leave the transmitter keyed while attempting to formulate your thoughts; if you must take time to think, disable the transmitter before doing so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid excessive wordiness! Shen responding to messages or acknowledging receipt of information, do not use excessively long phrases when a simple phrase will suffice, (i.e, &ldquo;we are 10-4 on your traffic&rdquo;, should be simply &ldquo;10-4&rdquo;). Air time is a precious commodity, and transmitting channels need to be kept open as much as possible; therefore, it is incumbent upon the operator to avoid wordiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilize complete number designators when calling cars. Avoid the use of personal names or titles as call designators. If it is necessary to use a name on the air, use the appropriate title also.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RADIO COURTESY:</strong> Operators shall at all times conduct themselves on the radio so as to present models of efficiency and professionalism. Frequencies must be monitored closely before transmitting in order to avoid interrupting traffic in progress. If you must have a mobile unit &ldquo;standby&rdquo; get to them promptly. In addition, unnecessarily lengthy tone alerts, argument, derogatory or humorous remarks, or other unnecessary radio traffic are considered to be breaches of operating procedure, as each may prevent urgent radio traffic from being heard.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="accepting-traffic">ACCEPTING TRAFFIC</h2>
<h2 id="heading-6"></h2>
<p>Operating personnel must accept any information from a proper police authority when requested to handle radio traffic. This information must be accepted without question, provided it meets the following criteria; the traffic must; 1–concern police business or is connected with law enforcement in its broadest sense; 2–be addressed to and signed by a police authority (rather than private individuals).</p>
<p>The telecommunicator should make every effort to tactfully assist the originating authority in meeting these criteria. Should there be obvious mistakes or deletions in material, duplications of previous traffic, or requests for broadcast by improper means or on incorrect frequencies, the operator should point out such facts to the originating authority, advising alternatives if applicable.</p>
<p>If a discrepancy arises concerning a request to handle traffic that does not meet the criteria listed, the requesting agency or officer shall be referred to the shift supervisor, for the final decision on handling or refusing the traffic. The telecommunicator may be called upon to advise the shift supervisor of any violations which may be incurred. Should a decision be made to accept the traffic, the operator shall handle the traffic as directed; however in all cases, the responsibility shall remain with the shift supervisor. The communications Director is to be notified, in writing of the incident as well.</p>
<h2 id="relay-of-information">RELAY OF INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Jurisdictional boundaries shall not apply to radio communications. In times of emergency, or adverse propagation conditions, during which station/mobile units normally contacted cannot be heard, operating personnel are required to assist in other situations/mobile units in establishing contact, confirming acknowledgements, and relaying fills or other pertinent information. When a car or station calls another car or station, and is unable to make contact after two (2) calls, the telecommunicator should advise the party being called or answer the calling party with an officer to relay the traffic.</p>
<h2 id="double-phrasing">DOUBLE PHRASING</h2>
<p>In any transmission which is said to be copied by another base or mobile operator, consisting of more than one (1) sentence, or a name, address, or group of numbers, each connected phrase should be read twice (double-phrased) in order to allow the receiving operator to better copy and edit the information. If written copy is not being made, and receiving conditions are good, single-phrasing may be sufficient. Any transmission which is unduly long in spite of concise wording, shall be broken (carrier interrupted) periodically to observe if other stations or cars have urgent traffic.</p>
<h2 id="microphone-voice-techniques">MICROPHONE VOICE TECHNIQUES</h2>
<p>Communications by radio may be hampered by numerous factors, among which are static, fading signals, interference from other stations, noise within the receiving or transmitting locations, improper enunciation or pronunciation factors and too rapid a rate of delivery. In order to minimize these factors and improve both the intelligibility and understanding of transmissions, it is important that proper microphone techniques be employed.</p>
<p>Voice qualities do much to enhance the understanding of transmissions. Operators should strive for a voice tone that is calm, efficient and professional at all times particularly when unders stress. Proper enunciation and pronunciation, (i.e. words spoken clearly and distinctly) along with the proper use of well-known phrases and appropriate ten signals, greatly improve the ability of the receiver to copy the contents of a message and eliminate needless repetitions. Noises caused by coughing, clearing the throat and objects in the mouth, (i.e., gum, food, etc.) may be greatly amplified, detracting from the clarity of speech, and thus should be avoided. The speed of delivery is also important to the understanding of the content; generally, a speaking rate of approximately 60 words per minute is preferred for copying purposes.</p>
<p>Proper mic technique is also necessary for clarification of transmissions. Shouting into a microphone may cause severe distortion of the speech even under ideal reception conditions, and speaking too softly may result in weak signals that are inaudible. In addition, all operators should guard against the natural tendency to lower the voice level as they speak, as it is essential that a constant volume level be maintained.</p>
<p><strong>THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK:</strong> Editing your messages to assure brevity and content before keying the transmitter will enhance the system use.</p>
