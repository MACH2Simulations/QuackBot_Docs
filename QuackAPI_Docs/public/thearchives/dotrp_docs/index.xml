Usable items This function replaces the need to add the snipped bellow for every item you want to use, the items still need to to be IN THE DATABASE.
ESX.RegisterUsableItem(&amp;#39;fishbait&amp;#39;, function(source) //fishbait db item name local xPlayer = ESX.GetPlayerFromId(source) xPlayer.removeInventoryItem(&amp;#39;fishbait&amp;#39;, 1) //fishbait is item name in db TriggerClientEvent(&amp;#39;esx_status:add&amp;#39;, source, &amp;#39;hunger&amp;#39;, 8000) //fill food TriggerClientEvent(&amp;#39;esx_basicneeds:onEat&amp;#39;, source) TriggerClientEvent(&amp;#39;esx:showNotification&amp;#39;, source, _U(&amp;#39;used_fishbait&amp;#39;)) //used_fishbait (for translations) end) Head to the useable items section in the cfg file.</description>

      <description>This is how you add items to core_crafting!
#FOR ESX
Adding Items to the Database. First you need to add all the items you want to use to the Database, a good way of doing this is in a CSV File! ITEMS.CSV
name label weight rare can_remove degrade_modifier unique description x y category The name of the item, always lowercase, no spaces or spec chars How you want it to be displayed in inventory a weight (0 if using core inventory) Always 0 Always 1 Best set to 1 Always 0 opt discription Core inventroy Size Core inventory category drink_flaming_slater Flaming Slater 0 0 1 1 0 Boom Peepo Drunk 1 1 drinks For images the must match the name and be placed it the inventory&amp;rsquo;s picture location.</description>

      <description>The stuff we have learnt trying to get these working.
FOR ESX Note; You might not Need core_weapons if you have Core_Inventory
Thanks to all the CORE staff &amp;amp; discord members (esp Grnphnx for the bits of code i have found to build this)
As per CORE documentaions do the following
ADD/REPLACE THESE FUNCTIONS IN es_extended/server/classes/player.lua

      <description>Cut We use the phrase “cut” in dotRP, this is a way to stop incidents that are making people feel uncomfortable, in some cases stop / pause a scenario and get things back on track or the most common&amp;hellip; to debrief after something has reached its logical conclusion.
ANY Character involved in a situation can call cut, when this occurs ALL players taking part in the current situation must stop and honour the cut.</description>

      <description>dotRP City Lore THE HISTORY OF LOS SANTOS 1 The City of the Saints
El Pueblo de Los Santos (The city of the Saints) was officially founded June 23rd 1869. The settlement was part of Spania’s colonization during the Sheep Jesus (Oveja de Cristo) Crusades of the 1860s. According to historians the pueblo was part of a three-part plan to colonize San Andreas. According to Historians settlers would build “a string of religious missions to convert the indigenous peoples into Spanish subjects, presidios to secure Spania’s military hold on the province, and pueblos to supply the garrisons with food and establish a secular, civilian presence in the territory.</description>
