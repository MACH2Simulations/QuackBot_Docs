When Noodle copied the script again, it stopped working because it couldn’t find the sound file.\nScript wasn’t working, i brushed it off as user error and told them they need to do some troubleshooting.\nThey didn’t troubleshoot and just got the boss to come take a look (they sent an email 5 minutes after i said i couldn’t help at the time). 30 second fix once i knew the error…\nShrug Emoji\n",

Some where up in nice cabs, others were shoved on the top of a shelf.\nGet a call about a classroom computer not logging in, naturally an ‘important’ users.\nGo up to the PC, yup doesn’t log in.\nTried the local admin account, that works.\nThe dreaded no network icon showing in the bottom right, but the link lights were showing on the Nic.\nCouple of restarts, pretty sure a new cable and some blowing later its still not working.\nI Can’t remember what the next bits were, but it ended in me starting to re-image the PC.\nSet it off, head back to the office. Then i get a call, Several of the computers on that switch had started to have internet / network issues.\nAt this point i had no idea and was far out of my depth so i went to speak to my boss.\nMe: I think its a broadcast storm.\nBoss: Why?\n(Paraphrasing)\nI Don’t know why i thought that. Looking back i think i probably meant some sort of network loop.\nIt sort of made sense in my head at the time, was messing with a network issue and broke the network.\nI Was wrong.\nI don’t know how much i did from this point, Almost 7 years ago as writing this, so i can’t remember who did the log diving.\nBut it turns out our Core switch had an error that amounted to “too many connections”, the number in the log was big!\nFilling in the blanks in my head, what i think may have happened is over the years between restarts, it had been counting every time something had connected to it or it just decided to be weird that day. But a restart of the core switch fixed it.\nThen i had to image the PC i had broke in the first place for such a weird issue.\nThis is not something i learnt from straight away, but now i look back at it and go “Look what you thought here and what the actual issue was”. Granted this was a higher level network issue, but i jumped to a very specific one far to early.\nI Still sometimes overthink problems, but am getting much better at the simpler solutions.\nThis reminds me of another story with the core switch, which isn’t big enough for its own story.\nFor whatever reason lost to time, i had been looking through the logs on the core switch, and noticed that it was giving a fan error.\nWent to check on it, at least one of the fans was still working, but there was one not blowing air.\nTold my boss, Raised it with HP after a slightly painful support call and some log sending, they over-nighted a new chassis.\nBut UPS* Lost it.\nWe’d planned downtime for just before site opened the day after it should have been delivered, but then couldn’t.\nWe had to wait (5?) days for them to declare it lost and then send us a new one out.\nSecond one came, and a day later the original one was delivered.\nA Couple of days later we scheduled downtime and the boss replaced it just before i got to work that day…\nThe one with the dead fan and one of the replacements got sent back.\n",

    "content": "Unfortunately, not the tasty kind…\nHP Printers\nDo I Need to say more?\nNearing the end of my time at the grammar school, the newly opened sports hall had a PE office in need of a printer, This was during Covid.\nWe went with a colour HP Laser printer, I don’t remember the exact model number, but as I Wrote this up “M402dn” Came to mind and if its not that printer, its in the same family / group / model line (Whatever they are calling it this week ).\nWe chose this for a few reasons\nPrice ‘Need’ for colour. Mistakenly thinking that it was compatible toner wise with one of our current printers. We/I didn’t know that HP Was being HP With that line of printers. The HP 4025 we had was a beast, despite it lying about wanting toner when it wanted paper. Nothing from Brother in the right price range at the time (Our Other main model) Story Printers being printers, it was an utter pain to set up and get printing properly too. I think this one was more of a pain than normal.\nBut now we get to the issue, and one of the Best/worse bodges I have had to have do.\nWe used compatible toners, with school budgets and far to many printers, its very hard to justify getting 1 OEM toner for the price of a set and half of compatibles, despite all of the issues that happen with compats.\nBetween install and the first orders of spare toner, I’d read the stuff from HP About the stuff they were doing with compatibles, but had also updated the firmware on the printer during the install to fix some issues.\nSo I Told Noodle that they should order Chipless compatibles, this made sense at the time and had made sense based on the settings i had read on the control panel too…\nI couldn’t have been more wrong!\nThey did not work at all, Computer says no, low on cyan (X/Twit Link Contains Swearing)\nThe printer was thankfully still printing with the stock toners, despite being at a lower quality. and after far far to many days of troubleshooting firmware updates etc, I had an idea.\nPrinter toners have chips on them, I don’t know what they do, but printers cry without them.\nImage from Alibaba of all places, as its the only one I could find close enough, no idea on the actual rights holder.\nI went to the printer with a spare toner in hand and a few tools. and given its hard to make this sound exciting, I managed to carefully remove the chip from the OEM toner and move it onto the compatible ones.\nand it worked, it showed as “no toner” all of the time, but it printed well.\nI Had moved on before we ran out of the compatibles that we had brought in “bulk”, but had said they’d need to bodge it the next couple of times but on the next order get the ones with chips on them.\nI can’t remember why we didn’t return them and get them changed, but our supplier was not the best dealing with anything slightly complex, we had probably 2k of new toner and drums sat in the office for well over 18 months and beyond me that we’d asked them to pick up and give us some credit back as we’d binned the printer.\nI Think the printer was getting revenge for me putting its grandprinter out in the rain (as a door stop) when it was being recycled.\nIt deserved it after the pain of USB\u003eSerial\u003eParallel and driver mess that I needed to do to get it to work on a modern \u0026 Win 10 PC.\n",

    "content": "APR 16, 2019\nThis post was Spurred on by a discussion on website safety and how to teach young people how to tell if a website is safe. I Somewhat hyperbolically said no website is safe and that the green padlock / HTTPs basically means nothing. The longer version is a bit more complex than this and i will go into it in this post.\nWhat are the types of SSL Certificates? This article (External Link) gives a more in depth explanation of each type of SSL Cert### DV – Domain Validation\nThis is the most common certificate for sites such as this one, they’re usually shared certificates meaning that many sites can be using the same one and it means that the person who controls the webserver and the domain are the same person.\nOV – Organisation Validation The second most common, they are usually used by bigger corporations who have no need for EV, However they would like an extra amount of trust. The BBC Is an example of this. This shows that a specific company controls the server and the domain.\nEV – Extended Validation This is the least common type, usually only use on sites where money or sensitive data is transmitted. Such as the natwest website. This is a significantly harder certificate to acquire as it requires a physical address among many other requirements for this to be issued. These are as secure as you can get.\nSo what does the green padlock mean? It usually means you are connected to a web server controlled by the same entity that controls the domain.\nSo it’s secure right? Yes and no, Its secure in the sense of your web traffic between your device and the web server is encrypted and secure* but this does not mean that the website in itself is safe.\n*Many Corporate networks use their own trusted root certificate installed on the device which gets used to encrypt the network traffic, which then gets decrypted, filtered then re encrypted using the correct certificate sent to whatever server it should be going to then the reverse happens for everything returning. This also means that (in theory) anything that gets sent via the network (passwords. usernames, bank details etc) can be viewed in plain text. And an end user would not be able to tell the difference even when browsing a EV Site. – Important note! No IT person cares or has the time to go snooping on your data packets.\nVPNS Also do this to hide and protect your web traffic.\nNote; The time changes due to the server not accounting for daylight savings\nHow easy is it to get the green padlock Less than the time to make a good coffee, see the video bellow. – Site used is totallypaypal.notreal.co.uk Interestingly it took me longer to write the paragraph above than give my fake site the green padlock (ignoring a weird glitch i had)\nWhat does this actually mean for me? If you are one a website such as online banking and it has the green bar / EV Cert, you are probably connected to your banks server and are as safe as the site is. And for everything else with the green padlock, you are probably connected to the server of the domain owner.\nSo Why did i say it was unsafe It gives a false sense of security, there has been millions of green padlocked sites that have been hacked. From sites similar to mine, to huge organisations such as Foxy Bingo and verifications.IO both of which had green padlocks.\nTLDR; A Green padlock only shows that your connection between your device and the server is secure. Not that the site is secure or legitimate. Avoiding (most) sites that do not use SSL (Especially those that you login to) is a good step in staying safe/er online. But is a tiny step in the greater scheme of things.\n",

Sometimes you can be lucky and just stick the broken end back in and it be fine.\nBut Rarely are things that simple.\nIt turns out that many biros/cheap pens/bics have the plastic ink reservoir that’s only a touch smaller than the 3.5mm of a normal headphone jack.\nPlastic is Plastic, and Plastic melts when exposed to heat.\nSo, what you do is prepare the device by turning it off, and then heat up the end of the ink reservoir.\nIf you are very quick, and VERY Careful, you can get the end into the headphone port whilst the plastic is still soft and sticky, give it a few minutes to cool then pull.\nIf you are lucky you now have a burn pen and the end from a broken headphone jack.\nI had done this a few times; Using the side of an old dell to not burn my desk. Succeeded once I think.\nThis is sometimes worth a try when the inside of a port is shielded on the motherboard and there isn’t a pokey hole to poke a paper clip though.\nI Tried the proper tools made for it with even less success than fire.\nI Think nowadays I’d probably just pull the shielding off the port than mess with pens and matches, but I Do have a smoke detector in my current office…\n",

I Selected what update packs we needed at the time, Windows Server 2012, Windows 10 etc.\nI Put the computers into groups; Student desktops, Teacher Desktops, Laptops, Servers. As would make sense for our network at the time. I Did a bit of testing on a couple of machines, Waited for all of the required update packages to download, and it worked as expected.\nNow it was time to push some updates out, I think I was doing this over the summer holidays, or just before a short holiday.\nSo, I selected all of the computers and released all of the updates.\nI then Deselected the servers, and then set a deadline for the updates of 7am Monday, thinking come in Monday morning and everything will be nicely updated.\nCame in Monday, got coffee started doing whatever, to get a call from a member of staff to say XYZ wasn’t working, if I am remembering correctly it was emails, so the exchange server as we had an onsite on at the time.\nDear reader, it was not just exchange, but all of the servers.\nSome of the servers were mid update, so I could do nothing about those, and a few were waiting to restart.\nI Denied the updates in WSUS and that didn’t help.\nEventually the midway through servers got to desktop, and I killed the WSUS Server until I could manually fix things, which took a few days.\nWhat I think happened here was the enforced update approval applied to the update package itself, rather than the computers that had the deadline, at least that was my understanding of what happened at the time.\n(The update was approved on all machines, with a deadline on some of them).\nOr now, as I write this out many years after the fact, it may have just been the server going “ooh I can update now as it had approved updates it could install”\nFollowing on from that, I Managed a proper update policy and kept WSUS running as well as it could whilst I was there. No more accidental Server updates.\n",

GOOD, NOW GET A FALL BACK.\nNow the shouty bits over, to the post.\nSomething every IT professional should know, and that they should tell everyone they know is that you need to be backing up your stuff, regularly and you should check its working regularly and you should test it regularly.\nMany people suggest AT LEAST 3 levels of backup\nL1: Local on machine backup – Such as version control, Having previous versions turned on on windows, Having multiple copies of the same file on your PC (ZIP Archives can help with reducing size) and something like a RAID Setup (Note RAID Is for redundancy in case of drive failure, it will not help you if you delete or edit files)\nL2: Local (Site) Backup – This is when you have a backup of the system on an external drive, but is still kept in the same room / building / address as the machine it is a backup of. These can include; Memory sticks, External Hard Drives, Tape Drives, Disks (DVD / Blue-ray), on another machine and anything similar that i have missed.\nL3: Offsite Backup – As above, but the storage mediums are taken offsite and stored securely (Note Make sure you comply with local privacy laws)\nL3: Offsite Backup (Cloud) – This is where Backblaze comes in, it is a Cloud based backup software, for $6 a month. Install it, turn it on and leave it backing up (Note it may take a couple of months to back up your things even with a high speed connection). It is pretty much set up and leave it be (assuming you test it and make sure it is working). They a similar service for small business and server / NAS Backups, however it is slightly more expensive.\nTL;DR Its cheep, easy to use and is a good backup service, Click the link bellow to get a free month ( and i get free months when you buy too)\nBACKBLAZE\n",

    "content": "Cut We use the phrase “cut” in dotRP, this is a way to stop incidents that are making people feel uncomfortable, in some cases stop / pause a scenario and get things back on track or the most common… to debrief after something has reached its logical conclusion.\nANY Character involved in a situation can call cut, when this occurs ALL players taking part in the current situation must stop and honour the cut. In the case of a game crash, it would be a good idea to call a cut!\nUsing “cut” would NOT be appropriate in a “loss” situation, for example: A Criminal has been cornered by the police and is about to be arrested. However, “cut” (may) be appropriate in the case of an unarmed store robbery where police come in and shoot the criminal with no provocation.\nIn this case this it may be better to have a logical conclusion debrief rather than a mid scenario one.\nExample 1 - Not able to be fixed within roleplay Here Mach (Fire Chief Slater), Ash (Det Cassie) and a police informant had been investigating bunkers, due to Det Cassie receiving intelligence that led her to believe a kidnapping was going to take place. In this situation, Cassie asked for Slater’s help as he had good knowledge of the city.\nIt made sense that Slater knew where the bunkers were due to his background and thus he was accompanying Cassie.\nUpon visiting known locations they came across a bunker, this happened to be the arms dealer’s bunker, (of whom Slater knew of through yet to be revealed). However, without thinking they entered the bunker.\nNow this was a mistake as:\nthe police entered without a good reason and without a warrant the broke in (which they didn’t realize until pointed out in chat as no way would the arms dealer leave there bunker unlocked, but the script in use didn’t allow us to RP that) here is the discussion that followed, cut is called at about 6 minutes.\n",

This is the overarching name when talking about the Emergency services within the city, as one big group, rather than indunvidual departments. This would also include city services such as the road team.\nThis Section covers any sort of cross agency work, however, mainly applies major incident response, rather than day to day things such as car crashes.\nAs Required - This will be used quite a lot when referring to which agency is in command of a situation and where the seniority applies.\nThis means is that whichever agency / person is most logical to command an incident will the person in charge.\nThis will also Normally be the most senior person from the given Agency [1]\nFOR MAJOR INCIDENTS, USUALLY THE MOST SENIOR PERSON SHOULD BE IN CHARGE UNTIL AN ICU IS DEPLOYED\nFor instance.\nin a bank robbery, the first member of LSPD Will be the one in charge until a more senior member of the dept arrives [2]. LSFR Will provide support as requested by LSPD\nIn a large fire, the first member of LSFR Will be the one in charge until a more senior member of the dept arrives [2], LSPD Will provide support as requested by LSFR\n[1] - It may not always make sense for the most senior member to be in charge, IE In a hostage situation, it would make more sense for (the chief) to pass command to the SWAT Commander for the response to the situation and that allows chief to manage cooperation with other agency’s\n[2] it might not make sense for the first member of a dept. to be in charge, IE a Senior member of the Fire Dept will have more experience with bank robbery’s than a member of the PD Who’s boots haven’t even got dust on yet. (Command would be relinquished as soon as a more senior member is there.\nERS Command This will be the most senior member of responding agencies, the aim is for all things to go through these people and these people making the decisions. And for the Agency lead to be command each agency with joint decisions made by the Senior staff.\nIE For a major fire, Fire Chief and Police Chief would be stationed at a command centre (or in some cases the air) and then command their relevant units.\nThis is how it should be for larger day to day incidents too\nAir units. See Flight Training For Shared Units such as Air x, the commanding dept will be the incident commander. So for a bank robbery Air X will be under command of LSPD, And in a fire it would be command of LSFR. This is irrelevant of the pilot or there rank, this does not affect the normal rights of a pilot to say hell no.\nERS Aircraft will under the general command of an ERS command centre.\nSome of this doesn’t make sense from a realism point of view, HOWEVER It makes sense from an in game context POV\nIRL There would never just be 1 trucks worth of fire and 8 PD in a city the size of LS\nand thus we have to take some liberties in how stuff works\nRadio Channels In the interest of making it easier for our viewers and new pd members and in the interest of being more current and modern we are going back to plain language for radio traffic.\nBREVITY is IMPORTANT\nSo THINK about what you are going to say, THEN say it.\nShort and simple is the key.\nStart calling BEFORE you turn on your lights\n7Mary3-Dispatch, Motor Vehicle Stop, Currently NB Vespucci and SanAndreas, grey honda civic, occupied 1x Male, PlateNumber\nCISA Guide\nSo for the vast majority of stuff you do, you should be on COM 1 this channel can be listened into on by anyone who has a radio., this is part of the openness of the city.\nAll the channels marked as NO encryption can be listened in on by anyone, it is a crime to transmit on a channel you shouldn’t.\nAll the encrypted channels must only be used when approved by a superior (see table for rank) / judge.\nPriority goes off first event takes primary channel unless they are able to move before hand.\nThis will be made easier when we have a person for dispatch.\nChannel 12 is for tow\nChannel 13 + is public radio space\n+---------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------+\r|Channel Number | Channel Name | Usage | Dept | Encryption |\r+---------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------+\r| 1 | Com 1 | Day To Day Usage, You should probably be on this channel | LSPD/LSFR | NO |\r+---------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------+\r| 2 | Com 2 | Secondary Channel for high call volume | LSPD/LSFR | NO |\r+---------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------+\r| 3 | Opp 1 | Secondary Comms, such as a chase or training to limit traffic on Com 1 | LSPD/LSFR | NO |\r+---------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------+\r| 4 | Opp 2 | Secondary Comms, such as a chase or training to limit traffic on Com 2 | LSPD/LSFR | NO |\r+---------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+------------+\r| 5 | Com 4 -

It is not modified by any reason of assignment while in the service, nor is the obligation lessened on the day oan officer puts the uniform aside and returns to civil life. Having been specially chosen by Los Santos to sustain the dignity and integrity of its sovereign power, an officer is expected to so maintain themselves, and so to exert their influence for so long as he may live, that they will be recognized as a worthy symbol of all that is best in character.\nIn this sense the trust imposed in the highest commander in the department is not more than what is encharged to the newest cadet or lieutenant. Nor is it less. It is the fact of commission which gives special distinction to the officer and in turn requires that the measure of their devotion to the service of their country be distinctive, as compared with the charge laid upon the average citizen.\nCODE OF ETHICS As a law enforcement officer, my fundamental duty is to serve the community; to safeguard lives and property; to protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression or intimidation and the peaceful against violence or disorder; and to respect the constitutional rights of all to liberty, equality, and justice.\nI will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all and will behave in a manner that does not bring discredit to me or to my agency. I will maintain courageous calm in the face of danger, scorn or ridicule; develop self-restraint; and be constantly mindful of the welfare of others. Honest in thought and deed both in my personal and official life, I will be exemplary in obeying the law and the regulations of my department. Whatever I see or hear of a confidential nature or that is confided to me in my official capacity will be kept ever secret unless revelation is necessary in the performance of my duty.\nI will never act officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices, political beliefs, aspirations, animosities or friendships to influence my decisions. With no compromise for crime and with relentless prosecution of criminals, I will enforce the law courteously and appropriately without fear or favor, malice or ill will, never employing unnecessary force or violence and never accepting gratuities.\nI recognize the badge of my office as a symbol of public faith, and I accept it as a public trust to be held so long as I am true to the ethics of police service. I will never engage in acts of corruption or bribery, nor will I condone such acts by other police officers. I will cooperate with all legally authorized agencies and their representatives in the pursuit of justice.\nI know that I alone am responsible for my own standard of professional performance and will take every reasonable opportunity to enhance and improve my level of knowledge and competence.\nI will constantly strive to achieve these objectives and ideals, dedicating myself before God to my chosen profession… law enforcement\nCODE OF CONDUCT Article 1 Law enforcement officials shall at all times fulfill the duty imposed upon them by law, by serving the community and by protecting all persons against illegal acts, consistent with the high degree of responsibility required by their profession.\nCommentary :\n(a) The term “law enforcement officials”, includes all officers of the law, whether appointed or elected, who exercise police powers, especially the powers of arrest or detention.\n(b) Service to the community is intended to include particularly the rendition of services of assistance to those members of the community who by reason of personal, economic, social or other emergencies are in need of immediate aid.\n(c) This provision is intended to cover not only all violent, predatory and harmful acts, but extends to the full range of prohibitions under penal statutes. It extends to conduct by persons not capable of incurring criminal liability.\nArticle 2 In the performance of their duty, law enforcement officials shall respect and protect human dignity and maintain and uphold the human rights of all persons.\nCommentary :\n(a) The human rights in question are identified and protected by national and international law. Among the relevant international instruments are the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid , the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.\n(b) National commentaries to this provision should indicate regional or national provisions identifying and protecting these rights\nArticle 3\nLaw enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty.\nCommentary :\n(a) This provision emphasizes that the use of force by law enforcement officials should be exceptional; while it implies that law enforcement officials may be authorized to use force as is reasonably necessary under the circumstances for the prevention of crime or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders, no force going beyond that may be used.\n(b) National law ordinarily restricts the use of force by law enforcement officials in accordance with a principle of proportionality. It is to be understood that such national principles of proportionality are to be respected in the interpretation of this provision. In no case should this provision be interpreted to authorize the use of force which is disproportionate to the legitimate objective to be achieved.\n(c) The use of firearms is considered an extreme measure. Every effort should be made to exclude the use of firearms, especially against children. In general, firearms should not be used except when a suspected offender offers armed resistance or otherwise jeopardizes the lives of others and less extreme measures are not sufficient to restrain or apprehend the suspected offender. In every instance in which a firearm is discharged, a report should be made promptly to the competent authorities\nArticle 4 Matters of a confidential nature in the possession of law enforcement officials shall be kept confidential, unless the performance of duty or the needs of justice strictly require otherwise.\nCommentary :\nBy the nature of their duties, law enforcement officials obtain information which may relate to private lives or be potentially harmful to the interests, and especially the reputation, of others. Great care should be exercised in safeguarding and using such information, which should be disclosed only in the performance of duty or to serve the needs of justice. Any disclosure of such information for other purposes is wholly improper.\nArticle 5 No law enforcement official may inflict, instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, nor may any law enforcement official invoke superior orders or exceptional circumstances such as a state of war or a threat of war, a threat to national security, internal political instability or any other public emergency as a justification of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\nCommentary :\n(a) This prohibition derives from the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted by the General Assembly, according to which:\n“[Such an act is] an offence to human dignity and shall be condemned as a denial of the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and as a violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [and other international human rights instruments].”\n(b) The Declaration defines torture as follows:\n“. . . torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession, punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating him or other persons. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions to the extent consistent with the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.”\n(c) The term “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” has not been defined by the General Assembly but should be interpreted so as to extend the widest possible protection against abuses, whether physical or mental.\nArticle 5 No law enforcement official may inflict, instigate or tolerate any act of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, nor may any law enforcement official invoke superior orders or exceptional circumstances such as a state of war or a threat of war, a threat to national security, internal political instability or any other public emergency as a justification of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\nCommentary :\n(a) This prohibition derives from the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted by the General Assembly, according to which:\n“[Such an act is] an offence to human dignity and shall be condemned as a denial of the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and as a violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [and other international human rights instruments].”\n(b) The Declaration defines torture as follows:\n“. . . torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or confession, punishing him for an act he has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating him or other persons. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions to the extent consistent with the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.”\n(c) The term “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” has not been defined by the General Assembly but should be interpreted so as to extend the widest possible protection against abuses, whether physical or mental.\nArticle 7 Law enforcement officials shall not commit any act of corruption. They shall also rigorously oppose and combat all such acts.\nCommentary :\n(a) Any act of corruption, in the same way as any other abuse of authority, is incompatible with the profession of law enforcement officials. The law must be enforced fully with respect to any law enforcement official who commits an act of corruption, as Governments cannot expect to enforce the law among their citizens if they cannot, or will not, enforce the law against their own agents and within their agencies.\n(b) While the definition of corruption must be subject to national law, it should be understood to encompass the commission or omission of an act in the performance of or in connection with one’s duties, in response to gifts, promises or incentives demanded or accepted, or the wrongful receipt of these once the act has been committed or omitted.\n(c) The expression “act of corruption” referred to above should be understood to encompass attempted corruption.\nArticle 8 Law enforcement officials shall respect the law and the present Code. They shall also, to the best of their capability, prevent and rigorously oppose any violations of them.\nLaw enforcement officials who have reason to believe that a violation of the present Code has occurred or is about to occur shall report the matter to their superior authorities and, where necessary, to other appropriate authorities or organs vested with reviewing or remedial power.\nCommentary :\n(a) This Code shall be observed whenever it has been incorporated into national legislation or practice. If legislation or practice contains stricter provisions than those of the present Code, those stricter provisions shall be observed.\n(b) The article seeks to preserve the balance between the need for internal discipline of the agency on which public safety is largely dependent, on the one hand, and the need for dealing with violations of basic human rights, on the other. Law enforcement officials shall report violations within the chain of command and take other lawful action outside the chain of command only when no other remedies are available or effective. It is understood that law enforcement officials shall not suffer administrative or other penalties because they have reported that a violation of this Code has occurred or is about to occur.\n(c) The term “appropriate authorities or organs vested with reviewing or remedial power” refers to any authority or organ existing under national law, whether internal to the law enforcement agency or independent thereof, with statutory, customary or other power to review grievances and complaints arising out of violations within the purview of this Code.\n(d) In some countries, the mass media may be regarded as performing complaint review functions similar to those described in subparagraph (c) above. Law enforcement officials may, therefore, be justified if, as a last resort and in accordance with the laws and customs of their own countries and with the provisions of article 4 of the present Code, they bring violations to the attention of public opinion through the mass media.\n(e) Law enforcement officials who comply with the provisions of this Code deserve the respect, the full support and the co-operation of the community and of the law enforcement agency in which they serve, as well as the law enforcement profession.\nARREST \u0026 DETAINMENT POLICIES\nArticle 1 In common law, investigative detention refers purely to a method of holding someone while a suspicious situation is being checked out. Detainment needs only reasonable suspicion to be carried out. At this point the detainee must identify.\nArticle 2 When an officer stops someone to search the person, courts require that the officer has either a search warrant, probable cause to search, or a reasonable suspicion to search. In descending order of what gives an officer the broadest authority to perform a search.\nIf an officer has reasonable suspicion in a situation, he may frisk or detain the suspect briefly. Reasonable suspicion does not allow for the searching of a person or a vehicle unless the person happens to be on school property. Reasonable suspicion is not enough for an arrest or a search warrant.\nIn any situation where handcuffs, improvised or otherwise, are in use, the detaining officer should do his due diligence every 5-7 minutes to maintain that the cuffs are functioning properly.\nArticle 3 In the event that an arrest is made under probable cause the suspect should be detained, read their Miranda rights, and escorted back to base to be charged and await their hearing.\nProbable cause means that a reasonable person would believe that a crime was in the process of being committed, had been committed, or was going to be committed.\nProbable cause is enough for a search or arrest warrant. It is also enough for a police officer to make an arrest if he sees a crime being committed.\nArticle 4 It is not the duty of LSPD peace officers to negotiate with or plead down charges. That is the sole duty of the District Attorney, prosecutors and the Judge.\nMIRANDA RIGHTS You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present with you while you are being questioned. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questioning if you wish. You can decide at any time to exercise these rights and not answer any questions or make any statements. Waiver\n“Do you understand each of these rights as I have explained them to you? Having these rights in mind, do you wish to speak with us now?”\nESCALATION OF FORCE POLICIES\nI. PREAMBLE TO USE OF FORCE. The use of force by members of law enforcement is a matter of critical concern both to the public and the law enforcement community. It is recognized that some individuals will not comply with the law or submit to control unless compelled to do so by the use of force; therefore, law enforcement officers are sometimes called upon to use force in the performance of their duties. The Los Angeles Police Department also recognizes that members of law enforcement derive their authority from the public and therefore must be ever mindful that they are not only the guardians but also the servants of the public.\nThe Department’s guiding principle when using force shall be reverence for human life. Officers shall attempt to control an incident by using time, distance, communication, and available resources in an effort to de-escalate the situation, whenever it is safe, feasible and reasonable to do so. As stated below, when warranted, Department personnel may use objectively reasonable force to carry out their duties. Officers may use deadly force only when they reasonably believe, based on the totality of circumstances, that such force is necessary in defense of human life. Officers who use unreasonable force degrade the confidence of the community we serve, expose fellow officers to physical hazards, violate the law and rights of individuals upon whom unreasonable force or unnecessary deadly force is used, and subject the Department and themselves to potential civil and criminal liability. Conversely, officers who fail to use force when warranted may endanger themselves, the community and fellow officers.\nII. POLICY. Use of De-Escalation Techniques. It is the policy of this Department that, whenever feasible, officers shall use techniques and tools consistent with Department de-escalation training to reduce the intensity of any encounter with a suspect and enable an officer to have additional options to mitigate the need to use a higher level of force while maintaining control of the situation.\nSPECIAL ORDER NO. 1 Verbal Warnings. Where feasible, a peace officer shall, prior to the use of any force, make reasonable efforts to identify themselves as a peace officer and to warn that force may be used, unless the officer has objectively reasonable grounds to believe that the person is aware of those facts.\nProportionality. Officers may only use a level of force that they reasonably believe is proportional to the seriousness of the suspected offense or the reasonably perceived level of actual or threatened resistance.\nFair and Unbiased Policing. Officers shall carry out their duties, including use of force, in a manner that is fair and unbiased. Discriminatory conduct on the basis of race, religion, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, housing status, or disability while preforming any law enforcement activity is prohibited.\nUse of Force − Non-Deadly. It is the policy of this Department that personnel may use only that force which is “objectively reasonable” to:\n• Defend themselves;\n• Defend others;\n• Effect an arrest or detention;\n• Prevent escape; or,\n• Overcome resistance.\nFactors Used to Determine Objective Reasonableness. Pursuant to the opinion issued by the United States Supreme Court in Graham v. Connor, the Department examines the reasonableness of any particular force used: a) from the perspective of a reasonable Los Angeles Police Officer with similar training and experience, in the same situation; and b) based on the facts and circumstances of each particular case. Those factors may include, but are not limited to:\n• The feasibility of using de-escalation tactics, crisis intervention or other alternatives to force;\n• The seriousness of the crime or suspected offense;\n• The level of threat or resistance presented by the subject;\n• Whether the subject was posing an immediate threat to officers or a danger\nto the community;\n• The potential for injury to citizens, officers or subjects;\n• The risk or apparent attempt by the subject to escape;\n• The conduct of the subject being confronted (as reasonably perceived by\nthe officer at the time);\n• The amount of time and any changing circumstances during which the\nofficer had to determine the type and amount of force that appeared to be reasonable;\n• The availability of other resources;\n• The training and experience of the officer;\n• The proximity or access of weapons to the subject;\nSPECIAL ORDER NO. 2 • Officer versus subject factors such as age, size, relative strength, skill\nlevel, injury/exhaustion and number of officers versus subjects; and,\n• The environmental factors and/or other exigent circumstances.\nDrawing or Exhibiting Firearms. Unnecessarily or prematurely drawing or exhibiting a firearm limits an officer’s alternatives in controlling a situation, creates unnecessary anxiety on the part of citizens, and may result in an unwarranted or accidental discharge of the firearm. Officers shall not draw or exhibit a firearm unless the circumstances surrounding the incident create a reasonable belief that it may be necessary to use the firearm. When an officer has determined that the use of deadly force is not necessary, the officer shall, as soon as practicable, secure or holster the firearm. Any drawing and exhibiting of a firearm shall conform with this policy on the use of firearms. Moreover, any intentional pointing of a firearm at a person by an officer shall be reported. Such reporting will be published in the Department’s year-end use of force report.\nUse of Force − Deadly. It is the policy of this Department that officers shall use deadly force upon another person only when the officer reasonably believes, based on the totality of circumstances, that such force is necessary for either of the following reasons:\n• To defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to\nthe officer or to another person; or\n• To apprehend a fleeing person for any felony that threatened or resulted in\ndeath or serious bodily injury, if the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause death or serious bodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended.\nIn determining whether deadly force is necessary, officers shall evaluate each situation in light of the particular circumstances of each case and shall use other available resources and techniques if reasonably safe and feasible. Before discharging a firearm, officers shall consider their surroundings and potential risks to bystanders to the extent reasonable under the circumstances.\nNote: Because the application of deadly force is limited to the above scenarios, an officer shall not use deadly force against a person based on the danger that person poses to themselves, if an objectively reasonable officer would believe the person does not pose an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or another person.\nDepartment’s Evaluation of Deadly Force. The Department will analyze an officer’s use of deadly force by evaluating the totality of the circumstances of each case consistent with California Penal Code Section 835(a) as well as the factors articulated in Graham v. Connor.\nSPECIAL ORDER NO. 3 Rendering Aid. After any use of force, officers shall promptly provide basic and emergency medical assistance to all members of the community, including victims, witnesses, subjects, suspects, persons in custody, subjects of a use of force and fellow officers:\n• To the extent of the officer’s training and experience in first aid/CPR/AED; and\n• To the level of equipment available to an officer at the time assistance is\nneeded.\nWarning Shots. It is the policy of this Department that warning shots shall only be used in exceptional circumstances where it might reasonably be expected to avoid the need to use deadly force. Generally, warning shots shall be directed in a manner that minimizes the risk of injury to innocent persons, ricochet dangers and property damage.\nShooting at or From Moving Vehicles. It is the policy of this Department that firearms shall not be discharged at a moving vehicle unless a person in the vehicle is immediately threatening the officer or another person with deadly force by means other than the vehicle. The moving vehicle itself shall not presumptively constitute a threat that justifies an officer’s use of deadly force. An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall move out of its path instead of discharging a firearm at it or any of its occupants. Firearms shall not be discharged from a moving vehicle, except in exigent circumstances and consistent with this policy regarding the use of Deadly Force.\nNote: It is understood that the policy regarding discharging a firearm at or from a moving vehicle may not cover every situation that may arise. In all situations, officers are expected to act with intelligence and exercise sound judgment, attending to the spirit of this policy. Any deviations from the provisions of this policy shall be examined rigorously on a case by case basis. The involved officer must be able to clearly articulate the reasons for the use of deadly force. Factors that may be considered include whether the officer’s life or the lives of others were in immediate peril and there was no reasonable or apparent means of escape.\nRequirement to Report Potential Excessive Force. An officer who is present and observes another officer using force that the present and observing officer believes to be beyond that which is necessary, as determined by an objectively reasonable officer under the circumstances based upon the totality of information actually known to the officer, shall report such force to a superior officer.\nSPECIAL ORDER NO. 4 Requirement to Intercede When Excessive Force is Observed. An officer shall intercede when present and observing another officer using force that is clearly beyond that which is necessary, as determined by an objectively reasonable officer under the circumstances, taking into account the possibility that other officers may have additional information regarding the threat posed by a subject.\nDEFINITIONS. Deadly Force. Deadly force is defined as any use of force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily injury, including but not limited to, the discharge of a firearm.\nFeasible. Feasible means reasonably capable of being done or carried out under the circumstances to successfully achieve the arrest or lawful objective without increasing risk to the officer or another person.\nImminent. Pursuant to California Penal Code Section 835a(e)(2), “[A] threat of death or serious bodily injury is “imminent” when, based on the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily injury to the peace officer or another person. An imminent harm is not merely a fear of future harm, no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm, but is one that, from appearances, must be instantly confronted and addressed.”\nNecessary. In addition to California Penal Code 835(a), the Department shall evaluate whether deadly force was necessary by looking at: a) the totality of the circumstances from the perspective of a reasonable Los Angeles Police Officer with similar training and experience; b) the factors used to evaluate whether force is objectively reasonable; c) an evaluation of whether the officer exhausted the available and feasible alternatives to deadly force; and d) whether a warning was feasible and/or given.\nObjectively Reasonable. The legal standard used to determine the lawfulness of a use of force is based on the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989). Graham states, in part, “The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight. The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments − in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving − about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation. The test of reasonableness is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.”\nThe force must be reasonable under the circumstances known to or reasonably believed by the officer at the time the force was used. Therefore, the Department examines all uses of force from an objective standard rather than a subjective standard.\nSPECIAL ORDER NO. 5 Serious Bodily Injury. Pursuant to California Penal Code Section 243(f)(4) Serious Bodily Injury includes but is not limited to:\n• Loss of consciousness;\n• Concussion;\n• Bone Fracture;\n• Protracted loss or impairment of function of any bodily member or organ;\n• A wound requiring extensive suturing; and,\n• Serious disfigurement.\nTotality of the Circumstances. All facts known to or reasonably perceived by the officer at the time, including the conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of force.\nWarning Shots.

Increased radio traffic has created the need to deliver clear, concise, exact information to officers in the field in a minimal amount of air time. Although each telecommunicator has highly individualized ideas of how dispatching/operating should be performed, this disparity has created certain problems, technical and operational, which are easily recognized by the experienced operator. Following a list of procedures for operating; many of which serve to exemplify problems inherent to telecommunications:\nVerify the transmitter is working before starting to speak. Make certain that the transmitter remains on during the entire transmission and that it is turned off when the transmission ends.\nWhen another operator or station is using a frequency, do not attempt to “talk over” their communication on that same frequency. Never break into another station’s transmission unless an emergency exists and it and it has been determined after monitoring that the traffic in progress is not of an emergency nature.\nLearn to use the ten-signals and phonetic alphabet correctly. Ten-signals are complete in themselves, and if not used properly may cause confusion. Avoid using more than two ten-signals in any given phrase.\nTransmit all information as briefly and accurately as possible, carefully editing messages without changing the meaning of the contents. Make certain the information is clear and concise before beginning the transmission, so that further explanation is unnecessary. DO NOT leave the transmitter keyed while attempting to formulate your thoughts; if you must take time to think, disable the transmitter before doing so.\nAvoid excessive wordiness! Shen responding to messages or acknowledging receipt of information, do not use excessively long phrases when a simple phrase will suffice, (i.e, “we are 10-4 on your traffic”, should be simply “10-4”). Air time is a precious commodity, and transmitting channels need to be kept open as much as possible; therefore, it is incumbent upon the operator to avoid wordiness.\nUtilize complete number designators when calling cars. Avoid the use of personal names or titles as call designators. If it is necessary to use a name on the air, use the appropriate title also.\nRADIO COURTESY: Operators shall at all times conduct themselves on the radio so as to present models of efficiency and professionalism. Frequencies must be monitored closely before transmitting in order to avoid interrupting traffic in progress. If you must have a mobile unit “standby” get to them promptly. In addition, unnecessarily lengthy tone alerts, argument, derogatory or humorous remarks, or other unnecessary radio traffic are considered to be breaches of operating procedure, as each may prevent urgent radio traffic from being heard.\nACCEPTING TRAFFIC Operating personnel must accept any information from a proper police authority when requested to handle radio traffic. This information must be accepted without question, provided it meets the following criteria; the traffic must; 1–concern police business or is connected with law enforcement in its broadest sense; 2–be addressed to and signed by a police authority (rather than private individuals).\nThe telecommunicator should make every effort to tactfully assist the originating authority in meeting these criteria. Should there be obvious mistakes or deletions in material, duplications of previous traffic, or requests for broadcast by improper means or on incorrect frequencies, the operator should point out such facts to the originating authority, advising alternatives if applicable.\nIf a discrepancy arises concerning a request to handle traffic that does not meet the criteria listed, the requesting agency or officer shall be referred to the shift supervisor, for the final decision on handling or refusing the traffic. The telecommunicator may be called upon to advise the shift supervisor of any violations which may be incurred. Should a decision be made to accept the traffic, the operator shall handle the traffic as directed; however in all cases, the responsibility shall remain with the shift supervisor. The communications Director is to be notified, in writing of the incident as well.\nRELAY OF INFORMATION Jurisdictional boundaries shall not apply to radio communications. In times of emergency, or adverse propagation conditions, during which station/mobile units normally contacted cannot be heard, operating personnel are required to assist in other situations/mobile units in establishing contact, confirming acknowledgements, and relaying fills or other pertinent information. When a car or station calls another car or station, and is unable to make contact after two (2) calls, the telecommunicator should advise the party being called or answer the calling party with an officer to relay the traffic.\nDOUBLE PHRASING In any transmission which is said to be copied by another base or mobile operator, consisting of more than one (1) sentence, or a name, address, or group of numbers, each connected phrase should be read twice (double-phrased) in order to allow the receiving operator to better copy and edit the information. If written copy is not being made, and receiving conditions are good, single-phrasing may be sufficient. Any transmission which is unduly long in spite of concise wording, shall be broken (carrier interrupted) periodically to observe if other stations or cars have urgent traffic.\nMICROPHONE VOICE TECHNIQUES Communications by radio may be hampered by numerous factors, among which are static, fading signals, interference from other stations, noise within the receiving or transmitting locations, improper enunciation or pronunciation factors and too rapid a rate of delivery. In order to minimize these factors and improve both the intelligibility and understanding of transmissions, it is important that proper microphone techniques be employed.\nVoice qualities do much to enhance the understanding of transmissions. Operators should strive for a voice tone that is calm, efficient and professional at all times particularly when unders stress. Proper enunciation and pronunciation, (i.e. words spoken clearly and distinctly) along with the proper use of well-known phrases and appropriate ten signals, greatly improve the ability of the receiver to copy the contents of a message and eliminate needless repetitions. Noises caused by coughing, clearing the throat and objects in the mouth, (i.e., gum, food, etc.) may be greatly amplified, detracting from the clarity of speech, and thus should be avoided. The speed of delivery is also important to the understanding of the content; generally, a speaking rate of approximately 60 words per minute is preferred for copying purposes.\nProper mic technique is also necessary for clarification of transmissions. Shouting into a microphone may cause severe distortion of the speech even under ideal reception conditions, and speaking too softly may result in weak signals that are inaudible. In addition, all operators should guard against the natural tendency to lower the voice level as they speak, as it is essential that a constant volume level be maintained.\nTHINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK: Editing your messages to assure brevity and content before keying the transmitter will enhance the system use.\n",

    "content": "dotRP City Lore THE HISTORY OF LOS SANTOS 1 The City of the Saints\nEl Pueblo de Los Santos (The city of the Saints) was officially founded June 23rd 1869. The settlement was part of Spania’s colonization during the Sheep Jesus (Oveja de Cristo) Crusades of the 1860s. According to historians the pueblo was part of a three-part plan to colonize San Andreas. According to Historians settlers would build “a string of religious missions to convert the indigenous peoples into Spanish subjects, presidios to secure Spania’s military hold on the province, and pueblos to supply the garrisons with food and establish a secular, civilian presence in the territory.”\nThe Los Santos residents were made up of 34 pioneers from Spanish, Mexican, Native American, and African descent. The 22 adults and 12 children settled around the area we know today as Legion Square.\n2 The land of Sickness and Sunshine\nYou can’t beat the San Andreas sunshine, but you can sell it! With the Americanization of Los Santos during the second half of the 19th century, anglo boosters - most recently transplants themselves - began to sell what we might now refer to as the “San Andreas Dream.” There was even a magazine called Land of Sunshine dedicated to promoting and celebrating the natural, temperate beauties of the state. With its Mediterranean climate, Southern San Andreas was a place where a new immigrant could “cheer himself with her almost everlasting sunlight.”\nBy the 1880s, droves of chilly Midwesterners – like Michael McTony, the founder of Vinewood – were streaming into LS, as were people with all sorts of illnesses and maladies. “The overworked and over worried class,” one San Andreas promotion read, “will find here a most soothing climate to regain their lost energy or restore the nervous system to its normal equilibrium.”\nAnd so long before Malibu became the rehab capital of the world, the Los Santos area was littered with sanitariums and health resorts. Although these sanitariums often offered little more than TLC, many who survived their maladies decided to stay permanently and soak up the sun.\n6 Kingfisher\nIn not so distant memory an organization known as Kingfisher and their followers came to the city. Their manifesto stated that: “True freedom can only be achieved when oppressive governments are torn down.” Kingfisher wreaked havoc in the shadows, seeding the government with their operatives and spreading corruption throughout the city until, eventually, the people of Los Santos voted overwhelmingly to abolish the Police Department, moving entirely to community policing initiatives.\nChaos, mayhem, and bedlam ran amok and Kingfisher were able to move more operatives into the city’s underbelly. Eventually they took over the gangs, arms dealers, couriers and even the petty criminals were all under the direction of Kingfisher, although most don’t know they work for a centralized organization. The Kingfisher organization sends its operatives missives through invitations running more like an intelligence or paramilitary agency than a criminal organization. Only the highest operatives in the organization know Kingfishers’ true motives. Regardless, money knows no allegiance so “God save the King.” 28 August 2022\n8 Lawless Los Santos\nAround 2017-2018 corruption spread through the governments of several states and no one could pinpoint the cause. As a result, police departments and governments in these states were phased out; adopting community policing initiatives, authoritarian governments controlled by shadow organizations, and anarchism. Los Santos was one such city that suffered beneath this corruption and in 2019 the people of the city voted to abolish the Police Department completely. Riots broke out across the city in the subsequent weeks after the decision. Mission Row PD was vandalized, looted, and defaced. Naturally, with the spread of violence Pillbox Hospital filled to capacity. Unable to keep up with rising demand, withering supply lines, and a revolving door of patients, healthcare workers organized massive strikes and walkouts until, eventually, Pillbox could no longer afford to maintain safe working conditions.\nGangs took this opportunity to run the streets. Turf wars broke out between the Grove Street Families (GSF) and the Ballas. With no active hospital, Pillbox was also pilfered and vandalized in an effort to get medical attention to those in need. Eventually some traveling doctors started setting up clinics around Mount Zora hospital. This would become a sort of beacon of hope for the people of Los Santos as Chaos, mayhem, and bedlam ran amuck.\n",
