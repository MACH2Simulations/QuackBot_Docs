<p>This is something i will add too overtime, but as i was writing out script goes beep i thought i needed to add some more context to why i end up being more &lsquo;mean&rsquo; in some of these stories.<br>
Where normally &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you just help them&rdquo; would be a very fair statement.<br>
This will be directly linked when relevant</p>
<hr>
<p>On paper &amp; in pay my role was a Standard T1 Tech role.<br>
In practice it ended up being a more T3/Sysadmin role. I Was managing most of the servers, WSUS, changing vlans on switches, Paxton, software deploy etc.<br>
The really really hard stuff the Boss or Mr A did, but they only had a couple of hours a week on a good week where they could spend on technical issues.</p>
<p>As I Was significantly more technically minded i was supposed to be focusing on the more technical stuff, and i loved the challenge of the harder stuff.<br>
Noodle was supposed to handle the more T1 Stuff and Paper adminy things, Password resets, Login issues, Purchase orders etc. They were also supposed to spend 1 day a week doing none IT Adminy things, like grants (not sure the what or why but its besides the point)</p>
<p>This didn&rsquo;t end up happening.<br>
In the end i was doing my T3 Work, 95% of the sites T1 Work and then to top it off fixing the many many mistakes they made.<br>
And there was a lot, most of which shouldn&rsquo;t have been made.</p>
<p>Basically i ended up doing 3 peoples worth of work, with no ticket system at the time either.</p>
<p>A Great example of this was the time i had to go to a funeral. Due to the distance it was a 2 days of traveling thing and to top it off one of my closest friends was having a bit of a crisis at the same time.<br>
Came back on the monday, many more tickets in the (new) ticketing system and nothing had been sorted from before i was off. Several of these were easy tickets i&rsquo;d expect even a component student could have fixed.</p>
<p>After having been to a funeral i had to catch up on 4 days worth of tickets (2 of my days + 2 of theres) and whatever came in those days&hellip;</p>
<p>I was not happy</p>

<p>Should have talked to my boss a long time before it got here about the issues<br>
I Think &ldquo;Wep on ized&rdquo; Incompetence was a huge factor</p>
