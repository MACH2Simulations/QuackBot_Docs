      <description>Another Late at the grammar story.
We stored student files in a way similar to this.
\\DC1\Studnet\2018 \\DC1\Studnet\2020 \\DC2\Studnet\2017 \\DC2\Studnet\2019The year represents the year the student would be if they started at our school at Year 7 (11 years old by Aug 31st).
At the time our retention policy was 7/8 years (the math is confusing as will be shown in this post).
We went to Year 13, so it effectively it would be the August of year 14 if they stayed in school for the extra year (trying to explain the context rather than what happened).</description>

      <description>Sometime Late time at the grammar.
I Realize as i started to prep to write this out it may not paint be in the best of lights&amp;hellip;
This person whom i didn&amp;rsquo;t help in this situation had far beyond what would be classed as normal support in learning the tools we used. Everyone in the dept had helped them at some point to learn this process.
This included several show, tell and Watch walkthroughs of using this tool</description>

      <description>Oct/Nov 2017
Important context, this was a week or two into my first job.
Looking back I knew nothing.
i&amp;rsquo;d been reading a lot of random stuff on Reddit, Stack etc to try and gain knowledge.
Due to its weird shape, and its size, the grammar school had many networking switches across the site. Some where up in nice cabs, others were shoved on the top of a shelf.
Get a call about a classroom computer not logging in, naturally an &amp;lsquo;important&amp;rsquo; users.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, not the tasty kind&amp;hellip;
HP Printers
Do I Need to say more?
Nearing the end of my time at the grammar school, the newly opened sports hall had a PE office in need of a printer, This was during Covid.
We went with a colour HP Laser printer, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact model number, but as I Wrote this up &amp;ldquo;M402dn&amp;rdquo; Came to mind and if its not that printer, its in the same family / group / model line (Whatever they are calling it this week ).</description>

      <description>Not with fire.
In My defence, I was told more smoke
Smoke being the Glycole / Water based stuff that&amp;rsquo;s quite safe.
For some reason the smoke machine had been kept in the IT Office rather that with the drama department. And somehow I ended up agreeing to Running the smoke machine during a production of Greece.
I like the idea of all of the smoke, but I Do try to be sensible, and not over do things like smoke.</description>

      <description>Before I Start with this I Do have to mention 4 Things
Bodgeit and Scarper Taught me this (These will likely be mentioned in further stories) It Was Safe / Risk Assessed (I Have written many fire related risk assessments) Do not try this at home (or work) This was done when I was the only person in the building So, this is a useful know how to have, if you have the ability to do it safely without annoying facilities / setting off a fire alarm.</description>

      <description>(nothing to do with viruses/crypto)
An important precursor to this is that Noodle was responsible for the backups. We used tape backups at the time: go into server room, shove in tape, check next day on the console it was ok, weekly restore test. There was gaps of over a month at times.
They kept &amp;ldquo;Forgetting&amp;rdquo;
And, we regularly went to \\server\F$ to access things from the servers.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I had just had a couple of days off for a reason, or if I Had been ill or whatever, but I Came into the backlash of this.</description>

      <description>Relatively early into my IT Career, say a year / 18 months, I rebuilt the WSUS server at my work.
Those who know the pain of WSUS know that to keep it working it needs to be rebuilt every now and then so it keeps working, and it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been working for a while so I took it on as a project.
&amp;ldquo;Money&amp;rdquo; is why we didn&amp;rsquo;t use SCCM/Intune</description>
