## Powershell Top Tip

A quick Powershell tip for you lovely people.

Make sure comments do not clip the end of your code or it will break as bellow

```Powershell
Write-host "Hello World" -ForegroundColor red#red is good
```

However a space fixes it

```PowerShell
Write-host "Hello World" -ForegroundColor red #red is good
```
