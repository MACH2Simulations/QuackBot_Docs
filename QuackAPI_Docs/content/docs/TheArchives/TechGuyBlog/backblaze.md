DO YOU BACK UP YOUR $SYSTEMS? IF NOT GO DO IT NOW.  
IF YOU DO DOES YOUR BACK UP WORK? WHEN DID IT LAST RUN?  
IS IT WORKING AND RUNNING AS SCHEDULED? THEN TEST THE BACK UP!  
THE BACKUP WORKS? GOOD, NOW GET A FALL BACK.

Now the shouty bits over, to the post.

Something every IT professional should know, and that they should tell everyone they know is that you need to be backing up your stuff, regularly and you should check its working regularly and you should test it regularly.

Many people suggest **AT LEAST** 3 levels of backup

L1: Local on machine backup – Such as version control, Having previous versions turned on on windows, Having multiple copies of the same file on your PC (ZIP Archives can help with reducing size) and something like a RAID Setup (Note RAID Is for redundancy in case of drive failure, it will not help you if you delete or edit files)

L2: Local (Site) Backup – This is when you have a backup of the system on an external drive, but is still kept in the same room / building / address as the machine it is a backup of. These can include; Memory sticks, External Hard Drives, Tape Drives, Disks (DVD / Blue-ray), on another machine and anything similar that i have missed.

L3: Offsite Backup – As above, but the storage mediums are taken offsite and stored securely (Note Make sure you comply with local privacy laws)

L3: Offsite Backup (Cloud) – This is where Backblaze comes in, it is a Cloud based backup software, for $6 a month. Install it, turn it on and leave it backing up (Note it may take a couple of months to back up your things even with a high speed connection). It is pretty much set up and leave it be (assuming you test it and make sure it is working). They a similar service for small business and server / NAS Backups, however it is slightly more expensive.

TL;DR Its cheep, easy to use and is a good backup service, Click the link bellow to get a free month ( and i get free months when you buy too)
