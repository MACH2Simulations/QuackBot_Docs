## Flight Training  

Due to number reasons, ALL persons wishing to be flight certified will be cross trained for both LSPD And LSFR Flight operations.  
They must also be competent in non-flight operations before being allowed to fly  
This allows us to have Air support more often, as it takes 1/2 people from a ground unit to have a multi role AC up, that it would just having each Dept run its own.  

This also allows for standardized training and quicker certification.  
And given the similarities with most operations it allows for better training across the board as well.  
This also allows people to use a wider range of aircraft than they would normally
