Aleksander Rudzinski is one of the more mysterious folks on the streets of Los Santos.
He appears to be your run of the mill freelancer/contractor but there is just something...off about him that leads one to suspect there's more beneath the surface.
He is adept at problem solving and is often contracted by LSPD for assistance on bigger cases.
