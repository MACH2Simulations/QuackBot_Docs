Moe Longbottom was an up and coming stock car driver out of Ontario, Canada. After a serious crash he was forced to hang up his suit and move on.
He turned to saving lives as a first responder at his local rasetrack. After living in Nova Scotia for a few years Moe has packed up yet again,
making land in the city of the Saints in search of a fresh start.
