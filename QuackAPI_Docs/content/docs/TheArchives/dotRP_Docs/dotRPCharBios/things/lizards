Who or what the Lizard People are, nobody really knows. 
Linked to a string of disappearances and the strange occult worship of the Kraken, all that is known is that these bizarre beings live among us on the streets of Los Santos. The Lizard People are "human-like" figures masquerading as every-day citizens of the city. 
They are intelligent and have the unique trait of extreme empathy. 
Take care around these creatures as they are quick to shoot first or ask questions later.
