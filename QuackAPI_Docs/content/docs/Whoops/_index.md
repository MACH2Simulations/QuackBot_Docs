### Rambling and Context  

Some of these stories need quite a bit of context / Additional info for the story to make sense, ill try to add a marker to where the story actually starts if its quite a bit of context.  

### Noodle  

There maybe some stories about a Co Worker I will call ***"Noodle"***, they had some very interesting ways of doing things.  

## Tidbits and Anecdote

Many a time  I have Used a Server / Desktop as a stool or a step, have yet to break anything important.  

Once had a printer that asked for toner, when it was low (25%) on toner, but had ran out of paper. "No it wants paper, its lying"

"No Bloody Clue", is better response to 95% of users than lying.

<!--
I have yet to have a ticket marked "Urgent" that was.

"Script doesn't work", yes it does, you just gave it bad data.  
-->
Dear Developers, for the love of all that's holy, give me a proper error message.
