We offer a free API to allow people to add there own Chat commands to a stream to pull info.  

> NB; !Commands are suggestions / what (Mach) Uses,  
It doesn't really matter how it gets fired, aslong as the right thing gets sent to the API  
This is NOT a chatbot, this is the baseline for a command that can be run from a chatbot...
