### Wombel 
There maybe some stories about a Co Worker I will call ***"Womble"***, they had some very interesting ways of doing things.  

## Tidbits and Anecdote

Many a time  I have Used a Server / Desktop as a stool or a step, have yet to break anything important.  

Once had a printer that asked for toner, when it was low (25%) on toner, but had ran out of paper. "No it wants paper, its lying"

"No Bloody Clue", is better response to 95% of users than lying.

<!--

"Script doesn't work", yes it does, you just gave it bad data.

Dear Developers, for the love of all that's holy, give me a proper error message.
