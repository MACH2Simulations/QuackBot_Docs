This is something i will add too overtime, but as i was writing out script goes beep i thought i needed to add some more context to why i end up being more 'mean' in some of these stories.  
Where normally "Why didn't you just help them" would be a very fair statement.  
This will be directly linked when relevant

On paper & in pay my role was a Standard T1 Tech role.  
In practice it ended up being a more T3/Sysadmin role. I Was managing most of the servers, WSUS, changing vlans on switches, Paxton, software deploy etc.  
The really really hard stuff the Boss or Mr A did, but they only had a couple of hours a week on a good week where they could spend on technical issues.  

As I Was significantly more technically minded i was supposed to be focusing on the more technical stuff, and i loved the challenge of the harder stuff.  
Noodle was supposed to handle the more T1 Stuff and Paper adminy things, Password resets, Login issues, Purchase orders etc. They were also supposed to spend 1 day a week doing none IT Adminy things, like grants (not sure the what or why but its besides the point)  

This didn't end up happening.  
In the end i was doing my T3 Work, 95% of the sites T1 Work and then to top it off fixing the many many mistakes they made.  
And there was a lot, most of which shouldn't have been made.  

Basically i ended up doing 3 peoples worth of work, with no ticket system at the time either.  

A Great example of this was the time i had to go to a funeral. Due to the distance it was a 2 days of traveling thing and to top it off one of my closest friends was having a bit of a crisis at the same time.  
Came back on the monday, many more tickets in the (new) ticketing system and nothing had been sorted from before i was off. Several of these were easy tickets i'd expect even a component student could have fixed.  

After having been to a funeral i had to catch up on 4 days worth of tickets (2 of my days + 2 of theres) and whatever came in those days...  

I was not happy
