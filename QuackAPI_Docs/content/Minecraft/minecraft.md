I Run a community Minecraft sever, over the  3 + Years we have made many builds. There will be a mix of community, Solo and mixed builds.  
I think the server started Dec 2020 with people actually playing Jan 2021  

It's a mostly Vanilla Spigot sever, with a couple of minor mods such as a bookshelf and Dynamap.  

The top players have many many hours combined, one of which has almost 60 days of playtime alone!  

In most cases ill Avoid interior shots, a mixture of time, web speed and some buildings don't have them or are better view "In person"
